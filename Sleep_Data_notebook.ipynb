    "# Stepwise methods to data exploration\n",
    " - Import data, and explore features: Feature exploration is performed to to have a thorough understanding of the dataframe.\n",
    "     - Questions to ask are the following:\n",
    "         - ~What are the features available?~\n",
    "         - ~What are the data types of each feature?~\n",
    "         - ~Are there Null, or NaN values in the data?~\n",
    "         - ~What are the steps necessary to clean the data?~\n",
    "         - ~Are there target features that are interesting to me/my questions?~\n",
    "         - Determine the statistical analysis that can be performed given the available data.\n",
    " - Cleaning and feature engineering\n",
    "      - Once a good understanding of the data has been established the following questions will help guide you through the cleaning and analysis of the dataframe:\n",
    "          - What questions can be asked with the available data, and what questions would I like to ask from the data?\n",
    "          - Has the data been cleaned enough to help answer the questions I would like to ask of the data?\n",
    "          - Are there features I can engineer to ask better questions, or obtain answers to the questions I already have?\n",
    "          - Make sure to write down an overarching qustion when feature engineering so that it remains a guiding tool during your analysis.\n",
    " - Analysis and Visualizations\n",
    "     - Perform sound statistical tests, and provide visualizations to support those tests\n",
    "     - The type of libraries used are vital in rendering aesthetically, and user friendly visualizations.\n",
    "     - [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org) is a more intricate library to work with.  [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) provides a more user friendly rendition that can be inbetted and interactive on a portfolio site.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Note: This exploration is being performed to practice using data visualization tools.  A large portion of this work can be done with the [Pandas Profilling Package](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html)."

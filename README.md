# Sleep Cycle data processing and visualizations

This repo was created to perform analysis and generate visualizations from data gathered by the [sleep cycle app](https://www.sleepcycle.com).

The app collects infomation based on your sleeping habits and petterns; my analysis attempts to begin to faciliate your understanding of that raw data and allow you to ask different questions.  If you would like a brief view of the results and hypothesis questions posed, take a look at my [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@mydata/my-sleeping-habits-over-the-past-year-90d08aa36a46).

The limitations of the app and my curiosity precipicated the initial explorations of the data. I had questions I wanted to explore regarding quality of sleep over two different time spans, which required partitioning the data; a functionality not accesible in the app.
- Partitionning was prformed using the [wrangle function](https://github.com/AVData/SleepQuality_app_analysis/tree/master/wrangle)
- Graphs were generated with the [visualization function](https://github.com/AVData/SleepQuality_app_analysis/tree/master/visualizations)

Keep in mind that I will continue to grow this analysis, as more things become available, namely step tracker, and heart rate monitoring device.
